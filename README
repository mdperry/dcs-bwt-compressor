This package contains an experimental data compression program
based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

Features include:
 * Modular structure that separates the Burrows-Wheeler transform stage
   from the compression stage and offers multiple algorithms for each stage.
   New algorithms can be added with minimal changes to the existing code.
   The algorithms and their parameters can be given on command line.
 * An implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler transform that is fast
   for all inputs. It is based on the algorithm described in
	Karkkainen, Burkhardt: Fast lightweight suffix array construction
	and checking. CPM '03.

This code is currently intended for experimenting with Burrows-Wheeler
compression and is not suitable for archiving.

USAGE
-----

Compiling:
> cd src
> make

Compressing:
> src/dcsbwt [options] uncompressed-input-file compressed-output-file

Decompressing:
> src/dcsunbwt [options] compressed-input-file uncompressed-output-file

Testing (currently only some modules):
> cd test
> make

Running the programs without arguments gives the list of options.
Further documentation can be found in the code itself.
